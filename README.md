# Professional Portfolio Generator (P2G)

## Description

P2G enables current and aspiring developers to create a simple, sleek, and professional portfolio straight from the command line! Through answering a series of short questions and prompts, the user can create an attractive portfolio featuring multiple projects in mere minutes!  The finished portfolio includes:
* The developer's name
* A link to the developer's GitHub page
* An (optional) 'About Me' section
* A 'Work' section showcasing the developer's projects. Individual project sections include: project title, language(s) used, project description, and a link to the project GitHub repository
* The ability to designate projects as 'featured' so they prominently stand out

## Built With

* JavaScript
* CSS
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## Installation

1. Download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) onto your local computer or server.
***If Node is already installed on your machine, you can skip this step!***
2. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristopherLawn/portfolio-generator) to your local projects folder
3. Open the Git Bash terminal and navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository project folder
4. Once inside the root directory in Bash, enter the command 'node app'
5. Answer the series of questions and prompts.  While the 'About Me' section and adding additional projects beyond the initial project are optional, adding both are highly encouraged to help users stand out from their peers!
***NOTE: All user-input answers are case-sensitive, so it is recommended that you check for spelling and grammar errors prior to submitting each answer!*** 
6. The dynamically-created HTML & CSS files will be written to the 'dist' folder inside your repository folder
7. Publish your completed portfolio using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
